# One Hundred Hours #

## Description ##
This is a small application for managing time spent on projects. In a [recent blog post](http://www.karenx.com/blog/how-to-get-a-job-after-youve-been-rejected), Karen Cheng describes a process for ensuring that you have the best shot at getting a job: spending one hundred hours on getting that job. This app is meant to track 100-hour projects. It's written in AngularJS and is a work in progress.

## To Do ##
- Create Factories for handling logic
- Add backend
- Style edits
- Change alerts from javascript alert boxes
- Add animations
- Allow for different goals (other than 100 hrs)?
